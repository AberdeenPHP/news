# Aberdeen PHP News
A web app for compiling, showing and emailing out monthly PHP and Tech news and notes.

Just a stub repo for now.

Some random early thoughts.

I want a way to collate links to news and tweets I spot throughout the month.

I would like others to be able to quickly add something they have spotted to.

I'd like to be able to privately add notes about the links, which forms the 'script' for running through the stories at our meet ups.

I'd like the links to be hidden until after the meet up.

At the monthly meetup I'd like to provide the host with a list of links, with a short title, which allows for easy presentation of the stories/tweets on screen.

Following the event I'd like a little more detailed description to be shown, along with the links.

I'd like to be able to generate an email sending all the links, and descriptions, to subscribers.

I'd like to be able to add/remove subscribers and give the subscribers that ability too.

I'd also like a seperate section of links to 'cool stuff' I've seen on the web which perhaps doesn't fit into the PHP/Tech news (or would make reading the news too long at the meet up)


I want to use a Laravel, Bootstrap (v4?) and vue.js.

I'm making this opensource as I can see it being useful to other user groups.
